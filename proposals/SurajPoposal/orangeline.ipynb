    "My project solves a specific but very real local problem for college students living on Mission Hill such as myself; catching the T to Ruggles for class when we are running late. My solution was to use the MBTA API which provides free and publicly accessible real time updates on all of their vehicles current locations, departure times, predicted arrival times to a station, status, and more. For my project, I'm using the API to track the Orange Line in the Oak Grove direction, and tracking all of its arrival times at Roxbury Crossing. The arrival time data will be fetched from the API, and read into a pandas dataframe; then I will implement an email updates function which sends you an email notification everytime the T is between 8 to 12 minutes away from Roxbury Crossing, so you can hurry over to the station. This way you don't have to constantly be tracking it yourself, you can just relax and wait for it to send you the email notification on your phone, and then you can get going. Additional implementations I would make include 1) cross-verifying the MBTA's arrival time estimation by using linear regression machine learning and seeing how accurate their model is and finetuning it if necessary, 2) creating a geo-map that allows you to watch the T's travel and see where it is visually. The first two questions of interest I want to answer for this project are: 1)How can we know when the Orange Line To Oak Grove is arriving at Roxbury Crossing? and 2) How accurate is the MBTA's prediction system for arrival time, and can we make it better?
