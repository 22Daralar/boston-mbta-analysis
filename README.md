Overview: 

We will use the MBTA API alongside the Census API to answer the following questions:
- What Areas of Boston are most underserved by the MBTA?
- What areas are good candidates for expansion?

We will implement the following ML models as we answer these questions:
- Linear regression to score blocks by transit need
- K-means clustering to group census blocks by MBTA accesibility.
